# Embedded Computer Networks

These are the lab exercises and and lab sheets for the Embedded Computer Networks module at Sheffield Hallam University.  

This academic year (2022-23) we are using the [Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 boards](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/mkr-wifi-1010) to develop Internet-of-Things applications. 

The Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 boards provide a simple to use platform based around the SAMD21 Cortex M0+ MCU and the U-Blox NINA-W102 WiFi module.
